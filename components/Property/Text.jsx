              The Graham Residence was built in 2011. It sits on a spectacular 10-acre parcel at 4,000 feet above sea level in the 320-acre private community of Rock Reach (within the Town of Yucca Valley). It is characterized by massive weathered boulders, ancient juniper, piñon and desert oak trees. Serenity and solitude are pervasive — neighbors are nearly non-existent. This is the Mojave Desert at its finest.
