              The Graham Residence is a mid-century modern retreat situated 4,000 feet above sea level on 20 private acres surrounded by massive weathered boulders, ancient junipers, pi√±on pines and desert oaks in the heart of Yucca Valley. Serenity and solitude are pervasive and the only neighbors are blue jays, hummingbirds, and the occasional coyote.  This is Mojave Desert at its finest.
