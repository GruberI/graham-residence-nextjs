                The Graham Residence is a mid-century modern retreat situated on
                20 acres of pristine high desert land surrounded by weathered
                boulders, ancient junipers, Joshua trees and pi√±on pines in the
                heart of Yucca Valley, just outside of Joshua Tree National
                Park. Serenity and solitude are pervasive and the only neighbors
                in sight are blue jays, hummingbirds, and the occasional coyote.
                This is Mojave Desert at its finest.{" "}
