<h1 className="text-lg pb-2 font-semibold">Hiking</h1><p>

You are welcome to hike anywhere on the 20-acre parcel, so long as you are careful not to damage plants or venture into our neighbors' property. There are a number of small signs indicating the property lines that you will see when walking on the property. Bordering the property on the east side is government land (Bureau of Land Management). You are welcome to hike in this beautiful area.
To reach this government land, just walk down to the road from the house and turn left. You will pass the carport and eventually you will arrive at a spot where the road makes a sharp left turn. This is the southeast corner of The Graham Residence property. Everything in front of you to the east is government land (until you reach the few homes you can see in the far distance).

<br></br><strong>Joshua Tree National Park </strong>- “It's known as one of the world's best rock climbing areas, but the desert hiking is fantastic, too. Straddling the transition zone between high and low deserts, trails here climb up prominent peaks, meander through cactus gardens, reach hidden oases, and wander near the ruins of ghost towns.” -Modern Hiker

<br></br><br></br><strong>Big Morongo Canyon Preserve</strong> - Open daily 7:30 a.m. - sunset. Birders flock to Big Morongo where several natural springs and a year-round stream attract birds rarely seen elsewhere. This 31,000 acre nature preserve has 2 billion year rock old formations. The water and surrounding lush vegetation also make the canyon a perfect home for a number of desert mammals and several species of reptiles and amphibians.

<br></br><br></br><strong>Pioneertown Mountains Preserve</strong> - A beautiful preserve full of incredible hiking. Our favorites are the Saw Tooth Loop trails. There is a 4.4 mile loop and a 10.5 mile loop. Be sure to download the Alltrails map because the trails are not well-marked! 

<br></br><br></br><strong>49 Palms Oasis</strong> - A 3.1 mile out and back hike into the national park that leads to a hidden group of 49 palm trees. A favorite of ours.

<br></br><br></br><strong>Sand to Snow National Monument</strong> - Black Lava Butte and Flat Top Mesa Hike. This hike rivals any found in Joshua Tree National Park and almost no one knows about it. You are not likely to see anyone else on this hike. Google Map search “Sand to Snow National Monument Black Lava Butte and Flat Top Mesa” off Boulder View Drive in Pipes Canyon. Walk up the trail and on the first boulders you come to on your right (about a 10 minute walk) you will find incredible petroglyphs on the boulders. Also look for the bedrock mortar (a bowl carved into the rock). Continue on through the canyon for one of the most beautiful hikes you have ever seen! Look for footprints that head off the trail to discover more ancient petroglyphs, carvings and bedrock mortars/metates.

<p><br></br><strong>Giant Rock</strong> - Considered to be the largest solitary boulder on this earth, this 23,000 ton mass was seen as sacred by Native Americans who once lived in the Mojave Desert near Landers, California. In the 1950s, it was a popular gathering point for UFO believers. Giant Rock is about 3 miles north of the Integratron. The rock and surrounding area are public land. The Giant is about 12-15 miles north of Yucca Valley. From the junction of Routes 62 and 247, go 12.5 miles north on 247 to Linn Road. Turn east on Linn Road, and go three miles until you see the domed building (the Integratron). Continue east on Linn Road, which turns to dirt. Bear left at the first fork. About 1.5 miles later, you'll encounter another fork. Keep right here and you'll find the rock.

<br></br><br></br><strong>The Integratron</strong> - The story is that visitors from Venus arrived in a flying saucer and told former aerospace engineer George van Tassel of a process for cell rejuvenation involving a dome based on principles of sacred geometry. He began work on it in 1953, calling the dome at once a time machine, a rejuvenation machine and an anti-gravity device. This white dome is open to the public for tours and demonstrations. Inside, there are two wooden floors with a few museum-type displays. A tour guide turns on an electrical device and asks everyone to meditate and try to feel the Integraton-focused energy.

<br></br><br></br><strong>Noah Purifoy Art Installation</strong> - A strange and wonderful sculpture garden. Noah Purifoy filled 2 1/2 acres of the high desert in Joshua Tree with a sculpture garden that grew out of the earthy concerns of his life, using cast-off junk like tires, car parts, bowling balls, foam rubber, iron, shoes, and old clothes bleached in the sun, as well as construction materials like steel, aluminum, weathered wood, glass bricks, Astroturf, chicken wire, old windows, adobe and aluminum. 

<br></br><br></br><strong>Cactus Mart</strong> - Dig your own cactus!

<br></br><br></br><strong>Smith's Ranch Drive-in Theater</strong> - One of the last drive-in movies in California! Cash-only featuring new releases & concessions including popcorn & hot dogs.
